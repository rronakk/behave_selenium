BDD_in_Python
=============

Repo for bdd testing with behave/nose

Worked with Selenium for automated browser and Behave for test framework that utilizes 
'Feature' files and testing 'Scenarios'. Each feature file has several scenarios that are then
codified by test steps (step_impl()). 

Hardest part was rerouting the form; short-term fix was just to go ahead and display the results route 
but render the home.html template while passing in the form object with validators firing.

Shoot me a message for details!
